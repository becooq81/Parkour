# Parkour
Developing a keyboard in Flutter as part of project Parkour. 
Parkour is a project committed to help digital device usability for Parkinson's disease patients who experience difficulty with motor movements. 

# Implementation
While relying on FlutterFlow for the general frame of pages, I implemented custom widgets for the keyboards.
